But as a rider for a big delivery app, he says, he could barely cover his rent, bringing in as little  as £10 ($13.24) on some days. “It’s a really dehumanizing and horrible experience,” says Mason,  33. “You have no human manager you can talk to. You either get orders through your phone screen or you don’t.” \\nThat spurred Mason to seek a better way to get meals to hungry folks at home. In July he  started Wings, a cooperative in the North London neighborhood of Finsbury Park that delivers  meals from local restaurants. With £20,000 in government funding and grants from foundations,  Wings has hired a half-dozen riders who work five-hour shifts for a guaranteed wage of £11.05  an hour, the minimum needed to get by in London, according to the nonprofit Living Wage  Foundation. \\nWings is one of scores of cooperatives sprouting up to battle the inequity of part time  jobs, an issue that was made excruciatingly clear as the pandemic fueled soaring demand for  delivery services. Technology companies behind delivery apps are under pressure from investors  and governments to offer better conditions for workers, who are often classed as self-employed  with no benefits or any guarantee of a minimum wage. \\nThe big apps have dominated the industry so far, because they have vast pools of money  that allow them to build brand awareness and create the complex systems needed to ensure  reliability, says George Maier, a fellow at London School of Economics. But all that spending  hasn’t yielded consistent earnings. Deliveroo and Uber Eats have yet to turn a profit, and  DoorDash was only briefly profitable during the second quarter of 2020 as stay-at-home orders across the U.S. boosted demand for takeout. \\nWings uses a service called CoopCycle, provided by a Paris company that charges about  2% of revenue for software that can track couriers and manage orders from shops and  restaurants. The company has licensed the program to roughly 75 groups across Europe, most of  them less than a year old and about half of which are supported by some form of government  funding, says Adrien Claude, who helps CoopCycle members gain traction. “Every co-op is  running its own business, it’s usually cheaper for restaurants, it’s bike-only,” Claude says. “And  couriers are members, so they want to take care of customers and restaurants.”\\nThe writer’s tone toward the issue discussed in the passage is', 'Choice_1': 'Concerned ', 'Choice_2': 'Informative ', 'Choice_3': 'Criticize ', 'Choice_4': 'Supportive ', 'Right_Answer': 3}\n",
