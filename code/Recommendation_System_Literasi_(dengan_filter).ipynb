But as a rider for a big delivery app, he says, he could barely cover his rent, bringing in as little  as £10 ($13.24) on some days. “It’s a really dehumanizing and horrible experience,” says Mason,  33. “You have no human manager you can talk to. You either get orders through your phone screen or you don’t.” \\nThat spurred Mason to seek a better way to get meals to hungry folks at home. In July he  started Wings, a cooperative in the North London neighborhood of Finsbury Park that delivers  meals from local restaurants.

Tamarin, monyet kecil Amerika Selatan, melanggar aturan ini. Dari sepuluh spesies primata yang dipelajari di Taman Nasional Manu Peru, misalnya, dua spesies tamarin, punggung pelana, dan kaisar, masing-masing menempati urutan kedelapan dan kesembilan yang paling tidak melimpah. Hanya marmoset kerdil, yang lebih kecil lagi, yang jumlahnya lebih sedikit. Kelangkaan tamarin tidak mudah dijelaskan; itu tidak dapat diabaikan sebagai konsekuensi dari diet, karena tamarin memakan campuran buah, nektar, dan mangsa kecil yang sama seperti yang dilakukan beberapa rekan mereka yang lebih besar, termasuk dua capuchin yang dikenal sebagai monyet tupai dan monyet malam. Meskipun proporsi relatif buah yang dikonsumsi agak bervariasi di antara spesies, sulit membayangkan bahwa perbedaan halus seperti itu sangat penting untuk memahami kelangkaan relatif tamarin. Untuk menekankan betapa langkanya tamarin, kita dapat membandingkannya dengan primata omnivora lainnya di komunitas. Dalam hal jumlah individu per kilometer persegi, peringkat mereka jauh di bawah dua capuchin, monyet tupai, dan monyet malam. Dan dalam hal biomassa, atau berat total individu yang menempati satu unit area habitat, setiap spesies tamarin hadir hanya seperdua puluh massa capuchin coklat atau sepersepuluh massa monyet tupai. Untuk mendapatkan perspektif lain, pertimbangkan persyaratan spasial tamarin. Tamarin sangat teritorial, dengan penuh semangat mengusir setiap penyusup yang mungkin tersesat di dalam batas-batas domain mereka yang ditentukan dengan tajam. Kelompok menginvestasikan sebagian besar waktu dan energi mereka untuk berpatroli di batas wilayah mereka, mengumumkan kehadiran mereka kepada tetangga mereka dengan teriakan melengking dan menyapu. Teritorial terpadu seperti itu agak luar biasa di antara primata, meskipun owa dan siamang Asia menunjukkannya, seperti halnya beberapa spesies Dunia Baru lainnya seperti titi dan monyet malam. Monyet titi secara rutin hidup dalam wilayah seluas 6 hingga 2 hektar, dan monyet malam jarang bertahan lebih dari 10 hektar, tetapi kelompok tamarin secara rutin menempati 30 hingga 120 hektar. Yang paling mengejutkan tentang wilayah tamarin adalah ukurannya. Bandingkan ini dengan 1 hingga 2 hektar yang dibutuhkan oleh tupai abu-abu Amerika Utara biasa, mamalia nonteritorial dengan ukuran yang hampir sama. Sekelompok tamarin menggunakan ruang yang sama banyaknya dengan pasukan capuchin coklat, meskipun yang terakhir memiliki berat 15 kali lipat. Jadi, selain langka, tamarin membutuhkan ruang yang tampaknya benar-benar tidak proporsional dengan ukurannya.\\nManakah dari berikut ini yang TIDAK disebutkan dalam bagian ini sebagai spesies yang kelompoknya menunjukkan teritorial?', 'Choice_1': 'Owa', 'Choice_2': 'Siamang', 'Choice_3': 'Titi monyet', 'Choice_4': 'Monyet tupai', 'Right_Answer': 1}\n"
