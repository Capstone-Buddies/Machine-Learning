# Machine Learning Repository

We are developing a recommender system within the QFlare application. This system suggests a set of questions to users based on their performance in previous quizzes, aiming to enhance their understanding in weaker categories. Additionally, we aim to introduce gamification for users' learning progress with the leaderboard feature based on their EXP (Experience Points). To facilitate this, we have also developed an EXP Point prediction model using linear regression model.
